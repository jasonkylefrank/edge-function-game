A game to test the purported advantages of functions deployed to an edge network. That is, "edge functions".

One of the big draws of edge functions compared to serverless functions is that edge functions are said to _not_ suffer the cold-start problem that serverless functions have.

Edge functions are also said to have incredibly low latency. This interactive game tests both of those claims in a fun way.

Besides testing edge functions, this app gives me another good excuse to learn other technologies more, including Next.js, Tailwind.css, Typescript, Framer Motion, and more.
